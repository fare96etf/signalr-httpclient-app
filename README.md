# signalr-httpclient-app
Small app that demonstrates best practices with HttpClient and Polly in .net by fetching banks and credit cards from random data api. Also, it demonstrates basic usage of SignalR library. Angular is used to show the messages generated by SignalR. Other than that, basic usage of minimal api, error handling middleware and cors in .net is showcased.

Backend: run the app in Visual Studio (port 5145)
Frontend: run 'ng serve' in terminal from frontend folder (port 4200)

Open http://localhost:4200 in your browser and update the number of banks and credit cards. After clicking the button you should see how SignalR updates the message.
If you open localhost:4200 in more tabs and fetch the data, you should see the updated message in every tab.
Generated data will be in browser's console.
